#### **Introduction**

The primary goal of this project is to validate the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) protocol by comparing ns-3 simulation results for latency and throughput with an analytical model. This research is significant because it investigates how EDCA prioritizes traffic to enhance Quality of Service (QoS) for different Access Categories (ACs) in Wi-Fi networks. By understanding how EDCA impacts network performance, we can optimize Wi-Fi network efficiency, especially where QoS differentiation is critical.

Metrics: delay, throughput, packet loss rate.

##### 3.Impact of Traffic Types Experiment

Objective: analyze the performance differences of different types of traffic under EDCA.

Metrics: delay, throughput, packet loss rate.

##### 4.Priority Handling Experiment

Objective: verify how EDCA manages traffic when high-priority and low-priority traffic coexist.

Metrics: delay, throughput, packet loss rate.

##### 5.Comparison with Analytical Model

Objective: compare simulation results with the analytical model to verify the accuracy of the simulation.

Metrics: delay, throughput, error analysis.
